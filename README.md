Trying to make language quizz in HTML, CSS and JS

This code is not finished at the moment

The code in this repository is like the game rules for a multiple choice language quiz. The code tells the quiz what to do when the player (the person taking the quiz) clicks the 'check answers' button.


Just like how a game has different levels, the code breaks down the quiz into small parts called 'answer buttons'. The code will check each answer button to see if the player picked the right one. It keeps track of how many answers the player gets right and will show the player their score at the end of the quiz.


The code also gives each answer button special powers, like the ability to be selected or not selected, by using a special class called "selected". It also uses something called data attributes to remember if an answer button is the correct one or not.


To use this code, you'll need to set up your quiz in a way that the code can understand, like creating elements with the correct classes and data attributes. Once that's done, the code will take care of the rest and help you create an interactive quiz.


This quizz is not working at the moment.
